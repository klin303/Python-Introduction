Lists 

A list is a collection of data values, represented with the []

Element: a data value inside the list 

Index: position of an element inside the list 
    - indexes always start at 0

Length of the List: how many elements are in the list 
    - we get the length using the len(arr) function 


Example Array:
arr = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd']

len(arr) = 4

Element at index 0: 'a'
Element at index 1: 'b'
...
Element at index 3: 'd'

To access a element inside the array, we use the []
To get a specific element, we need to use the index of that element 
arr[index]

arr[0] = 'a'
arr[1] = 'b'
...
arr[3] = 'd'

Traversing:
    - traversing is the process of visiting every element in a list 
    - the easiest is a for loop 

for i in range(len(arr)):
    print(arr[i])

This will print out every element in the array, starting with the element at
index 0


Easier way of Traversing:

Enhanced For Loop:

arr = ['a', 'b' 'c', 'd']

- you declare a variable that will represent each element inside the list 

for x in arr:
    print(x)
