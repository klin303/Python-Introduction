Python Basics

Key Facts:
- Python is a scripting
- Python is case-sensitive -> true is not the same as True
- Comments are made using the # sign


Overview of data types:

Integers -
    Common abbreviation: int
    Ex: 0, 1, -1, 10000, -10232

Floats -
    Decimal numbers
    Ex: 1.2, -99.2, 3.0, 0.03

Strings -
    Words and characters
    Sometimes abbreviated str
    Normally indicated by the "" but in python you can use single ''
    Ex: "The brown fox", "Learning123!", "100.1"
    Python: 'hello world'

Chars -
    Single characters
    In python, there is no char, just a string of length 1
    Normally indicated by single ''
    Ex: 'a', '1', '$'

Going between types:

- say you have a string, "12", but you want to perform math on it
- you need to first "cast" the string as an integer or float
- Casting is the process of converting one data type to another

to cast in python, we can use
int()
float()
str()

so to convert "12" to 12, we must do:
int("12")
float("12")

**Note: input will automatically cast everything entered as a string


What about going from a float with decimals to an integer which can't have decimals?
-> The float will be truncated (the decimals will be removed, no rounding)
Ex: int(7.9) = 7
