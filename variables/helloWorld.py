# Printing

print("Hello World")

# the thing with the quotation marks is called string
# a single character is called char which is written with single quotes 'a'

print('a')

# Note that whenever you print, there is a new line at the end

print("Hello", "World!") # the comma will include a space after the first string

print("Hello " + "World") # Concatenation (string addition), in Python it only works for strings
